/**
 * A view of a message prepared for matching, that still knows where every character came from.
 *
 * <p>The old plugin matched against a cleaned-up copy and then censored the <em>original</em> with a
 * second, cruder pass — so a word it had caught through an accent or a substitution was reported
 * and then left uncensored (the {@code molést} comment on the old project page is exactly that).
 * Here every character of the view carries the span of the original it was made from, so whatever
 * the matcher finds can be censored, masked or quoted precisely.</p>
 *
 * @param text  the view's characters
 * @param from  for each character of {@code text}, the first original index it came from
 * @param to    for each character of {@code text}, one past the last original index it came from
